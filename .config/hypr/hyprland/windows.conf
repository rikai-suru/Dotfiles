# ################
# Rule                      Description
# float                     floats a window
# tile                      tiles a window
# fullscreen                fullscreens a window
# fakefullscreen            fakefullscreen a window
# maximize                  maximizes a window
# move [x] [y]              moves a floating window (x,y -> int or %, e.g. 20% or 100. You are also allowed to do 100%- for the right/bottom anchor, e.g. 100%-20). Additionally, you can also do cursor [x] [y] where x and y are either pixels or percent. Percent is calculated from the window’s size. Specify onscreen before other parameters to force the window into the screen (e.g. move onscreen cursor 50% 50%)
# size [x] [y]              resizes a floating window (x,y -> int or %, e.g. 20% or 100)
# center ([opt])              if the window is floating, will center it on the monitor. Set opt as 1 to respect monitor reserved area
# pseudo              pseudotiles a window
# monitor [id]              sets the monitor on which a window should open. id can be either id or name (either e.g. 1 or e.g. DP-1)
# workspace [w]              sets the workspace on which a window should open (for workspace syntax, see dispatchers->workspaces). You can also make [w] to unset, will unset all previous workspace rules applied to this window. You can also add silent after the workspace to make the window open silently.
# nofocus              disables focus to the window
# noinitialfocus              disables the initial focus to the window
# forceinput              forces an XWayland window to receive input, even if it requests not to do so. (Might fix issues like e.g. Game Launchers not receiving focus for some reason)
# windowdance              forces an XWayland window to never refocus, used for games/applications like Rhythm Doctor
# pin              pins the window (i.e. show it on all workspaces) note: floating only
# unset              removes all previously set rules for the given parameters. Please note it has to match EXACTLY.
# nomaxsize              removes max size limitations. Especially useful with windows that report invalid max sizes (e.g. winecfg)
# stayfocused              forces focus on the window as long as it’s visible
# group [options]              set window group properties. See the note below.
# suppressevent [types…]              ignores specific events from the window. Events are space separated, and can be: fullscreen maximize activate activatefocus

#  Dynamic Rules  #
# #################
# Rule                     Description
# opacity [a]                 additional opacity multiplier. Options for a: float -> sets an overall opacity OR float float -> sets activeopacity and inactiveopacity respectively, OR float float float -> sets activeopacity, inactiveopacity and fullscreenopacity respectively.
# opaque                      forces the window to be opaque (can be toggled with the toggleopaque dispatcher)
# forcergbx                   makes hyprland ignore the alpha channel of all the window’s surfaces, effectively making it actually, fully 100% opaque
# animation [style] ([opt])   forces an animation onto a window, with a selected opt. Opt is optional.
# rounding [x]                forces the application to have X pixels of rounding, ignoring the set default (in decoration:rounding). Has to be an int.
# minsize [x] [y]             sets the minimum size (x,y -> int)
# maxsize [x] [y]             sets the maximum size (x,y -> int)
# noblur                      disables blur for the window
# noborder                    disables borders for the window
# bordersize [size]           sets the border size
# nodim                       disables window dimming for the window
# noshadow                    disables shadows for the window
# noanim                      disables the animations for the window
# keepaspectratio             forces aspect ratio when resizing window with the mouse
# bordercolor [c]             force the bordercolor of the window. Options for c: color/color ... color angle -> sets the active border color/gradient OR color color/color ... color angle color ... color [angle] -> sets the active and inactive border color/gradient of the window. See variables->colors for color definition.
# idleinhibit [mode]          sets an idle inhibit rule for the window. If active, apps like hypridle will not fire. Modes: none, always, focus, fullscreen
# dimaround                   dims everything around the window . Please note this rule is meant for floating windows and using it on tiled ones may result in strange behavior.
# xray [on]                   sets blur xray mode for the window (0 for off, 1 for on, unset for default)
# immediate                   forces the window to allow to be torn. See the Tearing page.
# nearestneighbor             forces the window to use the nearest neigbor filtering.
